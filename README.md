# Conversation, Not Delegation: Mastering Human-AI Development

A book about working effectively with AI—treating it as a thinking partner, not a task executor.

## About this Book

This book explores **intentional prompting**—a deliberate approach to AI collaboration that builds understanding, not just output. Rather than delegating tasks to AI and accepting whatever it produces, intentional prompting focuses on engaging AI in genuine conversation where you remain the architect of the outcome.

While the methodology is applied to software development, the core philosophy—**Conversation, Not Delegation**—works in any domain where you collaborate with AI.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into the following sections:

- **Part 0: The Philosophy** - The core distinction between delegation and conversation, with definitions of key terms
- **Part 1: Foundations** - Core concepts of intentional prompting and the human-AI partnership
- **Part 2: Methodology** - The six-step programming methodology adapted for AI collaboration
- **Part 3: Patterns & Practices** - Effective prompting patterns and practical coding examples
- **Part 4: Advanced Topics** - Scaling to complex projects and future directions

Throughout the book, examples are provided in both programming and business contexts, reinforcing that these principles apply wherever you work with AI.
