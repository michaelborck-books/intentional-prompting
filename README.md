# Intentional Prompting: Mastering the Human-AI Development Process

A book about effective programming techniques in the age of AI assistants.

## About this Book

This book explores the concept of "intentional prompting" - a deliberate approach to programming that leverages AI tools while maintaining human control over the development process. Rather than simply asking AI for complete solutions, intentional prompting focuses on using AI as a collaborative partner in the software development journey.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into the following sections:

- **Part 1: Foundations** - Core concepts of intentional prompting and the human-AI partnership
- **Part 2: Methodology** - The six-step programming methodology adapted for AI collaboration
- **Part 3: Patterns & Practices** - Effective prompting patterns and practical coding examples
- **Part 4: Advanced Topics** - Scaling to complex projects and future directions
